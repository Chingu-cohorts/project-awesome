### Tips for collaborating

Use a linter. This is a tool which enforces a style around your code. It doesn't matter if 1 or 30 people are working on your project, a consistent style is a good way to stay sane. **No way is 'right'.**    
If you are just starting, use standard JS guide. If you want to go further, make a decision about what is best to solve the problem at hand.  

Here's how to get started.
```bash
npm i -g eslint
eslint --init
> choose a popular style guide
> standard
> javascript
```

How is it used? The best way is to have linting in your own editor.  

How to use linting in atom with packages.  
1. install 'linter'   
2. install 'linter-eslint'
